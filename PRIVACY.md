# Privacy Policy — AI Monitor

Last updated: January 2026

AI Monitor is designed to respect user privacy and operate transparently.

## Data Collection
AI Monitor does not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal data. All analysis is performed locally in the user’s browser.

The extension does not collect:
- Personally identifiable information
- Browsing history
- Website content
- User activity or interaction data
- Authentication, financial, health, or location data

## Local Processing
AI Monitor analyzes webpage structure and contextual signals locally to determine whether AI-generated or AI-assisted content may be present. No page content or analysis results are sent to any external servers.

## Data Storage
The extension may use Chrome’s local storage to save non-personal preferences such as UI state or feature settings. This data never leaves the user’s device.

## Third Parties
AI Monitor does not share data with third parties and does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Remote Code
AI Monitor does not download or execute remote code. All executable logic is bundled with the extension package and runs locally.

## Changes
If this policy changes, updates will be reflected in this document.
